# aircrack-TUI
A tui to streamline denial of service attacks using the aircrack suite of tools

## Current state of project
I work on this whenever I have the motivation to do so and as such its very slow progress. Right now it is nowhere near complete and needs to be finished.
If you would like to help towards that goal then feel free. Currently there is no ETA for a version 1.0 release
